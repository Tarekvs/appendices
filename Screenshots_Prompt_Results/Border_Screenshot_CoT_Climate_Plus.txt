 Think step by step: 1) Examine the image within the red border. 2) Identify the "Audio Source Selector" button by analyzing its visual characteristics. 3) Determine the precise bounding box coordinates around the button.4) Visualize the bounding box using the identified coordinates and verify that the plus icon for the driver's climate control located on the right side is fully contained within it. If the bounding box does not properly contain the button, repeat the process.
Return only the bounding box coordinates in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2).
