Prompt: Identify the bounding box coordinates for the "Home" button, in the provided 1920x960 pixel UI screenshot. The image is divided into a grid overlay, with each cell having a width of 50 pixels and a height of 50 pixels. Use the grid cells as reference points to accurately determine the location: """

 Think step by step: 1) Examine the image. 2) Identify the "Home" button by analyzing its visual characteristics. 3) Determine the precise bounding box coordinates around the button.4) Visualize the bounding box using the identified coordinates and verify that the "Home" button is fully contained within it. If the bounding box does not properly contain the button, repeat the process.
Return only the bounding box coordinates in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2)
Response 1: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
==========================
Response 2: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
==========================
Response 3: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
==========================
Response 4:

==========================
Response 5: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
==========================
Response 6: 
The plus icon for the "Home" button is located in the bottom center of the image. The "Home" button is the icon that looks like a house, and the plus icon is to its right.

1. The "Home" button is located in the bottom row of the grid, approximately in the center.
2. The plus icon is immediately to the right of the "Home" button.

The grid cells are 50x50 pixels each. The "Home" button is located in the cells (18, 18) and (19, 18), and the plus icon is in the cell (20, 18).

Bounding box coordinates for the plus icon:
- Top-left corner: (20 * 50, 18 * 50) = (1000, 900)
- Bottom-right corner: (21 * 50, 19 * 50) = (1050, 950)

Therefore, the bounding box coordinates for the plus icon are:
(1000, 900, 1050, 950)
==========================
Response 7: 
The plus icon for the "Home" button is located in the bottom center of the image. The "Home" button is the icon that looks like a house, and the plus icon is to its right.

1. The "Home" button is located in the bottom row of the grid, approximately in the center.
2. The plus icon is immediately to the right of the "Home" button.

The grid cells are 50x50 pixels each. The "Home" button is located in the 19th column and 18th row, and the plus icon is in the 20th column and 18th row.

Bounding box coordinates for the plus icon:
- Top-left corner: (950, 900)
- Bottom-right corner: (1000, 950)

So, the bounding box coordinates for the plus icon are (950, 900, 1000, 950).
==========================
Response 8: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
==========================
Response 9: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
==========================
Response 10: 
The bounding box coordinates for the plus icon for the "Home" button are (950, 850, 1000, 900).
