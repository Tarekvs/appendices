 Think step by step: 1) Examine the image within the red border. 2) Identify the button to unmute the current playing radio station by analyzing its visual characteristics. 3) Determine the precise bounding box coordinates around the button.4) Visualize the bounding box using the identified coordinates and verify that the button to unmute the current playing radio station is fully contained within it. If the bounding box does not properly contain the button, repeat the process.
Return only the bounding box coordinates in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2).
